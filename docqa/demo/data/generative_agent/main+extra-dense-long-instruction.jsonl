In these visions, computationally powered agents act consistently with their past experiences and react believably to their environments. Such simulations of human behavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with realistic social phenomena [26, 79], train people how to handle rare yet difficult interpersonal situations [43, 51, 93], test social science theories [11, 45], craft model human processors for theory and usability testing [21, 38, 50], power ubiquitous computing applications [30] and social robots [9, 13], and underpin non-playable game characters [58, 84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an open world.\n\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [84, 108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [17] that can simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [38, 79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would be better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing memories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade over time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold between multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can retrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect on those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences, and apply that reasoning to create *plans and reactions* that both make sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent's behavior.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce *generative agents*—agents that draw on generative models to simulate believable human behavior—and demonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both individual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw a wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and their environment; they create daily plans that reflect their characteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan when appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their environment or commands them in natural language. For instance, generative agents turn off the stove when they see that their breakfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and stop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\n\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social dynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses, and coordination arises across agents.\n\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture that stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate believable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture comprises three main components. The first is the *memory stream*, a long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a comprehensive list of the agent's experiences. The retrieval model combines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records that are needed to inform the agent's moment-to-moment behavior.\n\nThe second is *reflection*, which synthesizes memories into higher-level inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions about itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is planning, which translates those conclusions and the current environment into high-level action plans and then recursively into detailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and plans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent's future behavior.\n\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from role-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In social role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could safely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When prototyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary personas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold over time.

If an end user or developer wanted the town to host an in-game Valentine's Day party, for example, traditional game environments would require scripting tens of characters' behavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it is sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a party. Despite many potential points of failure—the party planner must remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must remember the invitation, those who remember must decide to actually show up, and other possible points of failure—agents in our environment succeed.

From sandbox games such as The Sims to applications such as cognitive models [21] and virtual environments [9, 58], for over four decades researchers and practitioners have envisioned computational agents that can serve as believable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally powered agents act consistently with their past experiences and react believably to their environments. Such simulations of human behavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with realistic social phenomena [26, 79], train people how to handle rare yet difficult interpersonal situations [43, 51, 93], test social science theories [11, 45], craft model human processors for theory and usability testing [21, 38, 50], power ubiquitous computing applications [30] and social robots [9, 13], and underpin non-playable game characters [58, 84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an open world.\n\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [84, 108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [17] that can simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [38, 79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would be better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing memories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade over time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold between multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can retrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect on those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences, and apply that reasoning to create *plans and reactions* that both make sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent's behavior.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce *generative agents*—agents that draw on generative models to simulate believable human behavior—and demonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both individual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw a wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and their environment; they create daily plans that reflect their characteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan when appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their environment or commands them in natural language. For instance, generative agents turn off the stove when they see that their breakfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and stop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\n\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social dynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses, and coordination arises across agents.\n\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture that stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate believable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture comprises three main components. The first is the *memory stream*, a long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a comprehensive list of the agent's experiences. The retrieval model combines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records that are needed to inform the agent's moment-to-moment behavior.\n\nThe second is *reflection*, which synthesizes memories into higher-level inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions about itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is planning, which translates those conclusions and the current environment into high-level action plans and then recursively into detailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and plans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent's future behavior.\n\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from role-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In social role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could safely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When prototyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary personas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold over time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to create a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such as The Sims.1 By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large language model [76], we manifest a small society of twenty five agents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact with these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town to host an in-game Valentine's Day party, for example, traditional game environments would require scripting tens of characters' behavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it is sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a party. Despite many potential points of failure—the party planner must remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must remember the invitation, those who remember must decide to actually show up, and other possible points of failure—agents in our environment succeed. They spread the word about the party and then show up, with one agent even asking another agent on a date to the party, all from this single user-generated seed suggestion.\n\new conducted two evaluations of generative agents: a controlled evaluation to test whether the agents produce believable individual behaviors in isolation, and an end-to-end evaluation where the generative agents interacted with each other in open-ended ways over two days of game time to understand their stability and emergent social behaviors. In the technical evaluation, we leverage a methodological opportunity to evaluate an agent's knowledge and behavior by \"interviewing\" it in natural language to probe agents' ability to stay in character, remember, plan, react, and reflect accurately. We compared several ablations that limit agents' access to memory, reflection, and planning. We observe that each of these components is critical to strong performance across these interview tasks.

Believable agents are designed to provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the way they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition, similar to the characters in Disney movies [9, 95]. These agents can populate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we inhabit [9, 58], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent behaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents with the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hypothetical simulations of individuals and communities [19, 35, 70].\n\nHistorically, these agents were developed in the context of intelligent game NPCs [58, 84]. Creating NPCs with believable behavior, if possible, could enhance player experiences in games and interactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [7, 15, 48, 92] and social interactions with the agents [110]. However, more importantly, game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations of real-world affordances, and as observed by Laird and van Lent in 2001, these simulated worlds offer accessible testbeds for developers of believable agents to finesse the agents' cognitive capabilities without worrying about implementing robotics in the real world or creating simulation environments from scratch [58, 84].\n\nA diverse set of approaches to creating believable agents emerged over the past four decades. In implementation, however, these approaches often simplified the environment or dimensions of agent behavior to make the effort more manageable [16, 72]. Rule-based approaches, such as finite-state machines [90, 96] and behavior trees [40, 53, 81], account for the brute force approach of human-authoring the agent's behavior [70]. They provide a straightforward way of creating simple agents that is still the most dominant approach today [68, 73, 109], and can even handle rudimentary social interactions, as shown in simulation games such as Mass Effect [12] and The Sims [6] series. Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior that can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interactions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting agent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their interactions [69–71], and cannot perform new procedures that were not hard-coded in their script [90, 96].\n\nOn the other hand, prevalent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such as reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of manual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have achieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such as AlphaStar for Starcraft [98] and OpenAI Five for Data 2 [10]. However, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games with readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can optimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating believable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90].\n\nCognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell, aimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive set of cognitive functions [75] that suited the all-encompassing nature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled some of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance, Quakebot-SOAR [59] and ICARUS [24, 63] generated NPCs in first-person shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [80] generated pilots in aerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these agents differed (Quakebot- and TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [60], while ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by SOAR and ACT-R [5]), but they shared the same underlying principle [61]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories, filled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in perceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment and matching it with one of the manually crafted action procedures [57, 96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed to be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and exhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of action was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and they did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be inspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed mostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter games [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63].\n\nToday, creating believable agents as described in its original definition remains an open problem [84, 108]. Many have moved on, arguing that although existing approaches for creating believable agents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough to support existing gameplay and interactions [23, 74, 108]. Our argument is that large language models offer an opportunity to re-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective architecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior. We offer a step toward such an architecture in this paper.\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: What are believable agents designed to provide?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Believable agents are designed to provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the way they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition, similar to the characters in Disney movies.

Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed to be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and exhibited robust behavior for their time.

Believable agents are designed to provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the way they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition, similar to the characters in Disney movies [9, 95]. These agents can populate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we inhabit [9, 58], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent behaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents with the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hypothetical simulations of individuals and communities [19, 35, 70].\n\nHistorically, these agents were developed in the context of intelligent game NPCs [58, 84]. Creating NPCs with believable behavior, if possible, could enhance player experiences in games and interactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [7, 15, 48, 92] and social interactions with the agents [110]. However, more importantly, game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations of real-world affordances, and as observed by Laird and van Lent in 2001, these simulated worlds offer accessible testbeds for developers of believable agents to finesse the agents' cognitive capabilities without worrying about implementing robotics in the real world or creating simulation environments from scratch [58, 84].\n\nA diverse set of approaches to creating believable agents emerged over the past four decades. In implementation, however, these approaches often simplified the environment or dimensions of agent behavior to make the effort more manageable [16, 72]. Rule-based approaches, such as finite-state machines [90, 96] and behavior trees [40, 53, 81], account for the brute force approach of human-authoring the agent's behavior [70]. They provide a straightforward way of creating simple agents that is still the most dominant approach today [68, 73, 109], and can even handle rudimentary social interactions, as shown in simulation games such as Mass Effect [12] and The Sims [6] series. Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior that can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interactions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting agent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their interactions [69–71], and cannot perform new procedures that were not hard-coded in their script [90, 96].\n\nOn the other hand, prevalent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such as reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of manual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have achieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such as AlphaStar for Starcraft [98] and OpenAI Five for Data 2 [10]. However, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games with readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can optimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating believable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90].\n\nCognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell, aimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive set of cognitive functions [75] that suited the all-encompassing nature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled some of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance, Quakebot-SOAR [59] and ICARUS [24, 63] generated NPCs in first-person shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [80] generated pilots in aerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these agents differed (Quakebot- and TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [60], while ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by SOAR and ACT-R [5]), but they shared the same underlying principle [61]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories, filled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in perceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment and matching it with one of the manually crafted action procedures [57, 96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed to be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and exhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of action was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and they did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be inspired to seek new behavior.

Each agent is represented by a simple sprite avatar. We authored one paragraph of natural language description to depict each agent's identity, including their occupation and relationship with other agents, as seed memories. For example, John Lin has the following description:\n\nJohn Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow Market and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He is always looking for ways to make the process of getting medication easier for his customers; John Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who is a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is a student studying music theory; John Lin loves his family very much; John Lin has known the old couple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore, for a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a kind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor, Yuriko Yamamoto, well; John Lin knows of his neighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but has not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno are colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy; John Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to discuss local politics together; John Lin knows the Moreno family somewhat well - the husband Tom Moreno and the wife Jane Moreno.\n\nEach semicolon-delimited phrase is entered into the agent's initial memory as memories at the start of the simulation.\n\n### 3.1.1 Inter-Agent Communication\n\nThe agents interact with the world by their actions, and with each other through natural language. At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a natural language statement describing their current action, such as \"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family on the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This statement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the sandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as a set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action in the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a language model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which appear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as 📝, while \"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as 📧. The full natural language description of the action can be accessed by clicking on the agent avatar.\n\nAgents communicate with each other in full natural language. Agents are aware of other agents in their local area, and the generative agent architecture determines whether they walk by or engage in conversation. Here, a sample in the middle of a conversation between the agents Isabella Rodriguez and Tom Moreno about the upcoming election:\n\nIsabella: I'm still weighing my options, but I've been discussing the election with Sam Moore. What are your thoughts on him?\nTom: To be honest, I don't like Sam Moore. I think he's out of touch with the community and doesn't have our best interests at heart.\n\n### 3.1.2 User Controls\n\nA user running this simulation can steer the simulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent through conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the form of an 'inner voice'.\n\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language, by specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For example, if the user specifies that they are a news \"reporter\" and asks about the upcoming election, \"Who is running for office?\", the John agent replies:\n\nJohn: My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking about the upcoming election and discussing the candidate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him because we like his platform.\n\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the persona of the agent's \"inner voice\"—this makes the agent more likely to treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \"You are going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\" by a user as John's inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares his candidacy with his wife and son.\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: How many agents inhabit Smallville?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Smallville is inhabited by a community of 25 unique agents, each represented by a simple sprite avatar according to the provided reference."}]}

For example, if the user specifies that they are a news \"reporter\" and asks about the upcoming election, \"Who is running for office?\", the John agent replies:\n\nJohn: My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking about the upcoming election and discussing the candidate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him because we like his platform.\n\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the persona of the agent's \"inner voice\"—this makes the agent more likely to treat the statement as a directive.

For example, a bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator can be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make breakfast. End users can also reshape an agent's environment in Smallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent in natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast in the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove from \"turned on\" to \"burning\" by inputting a command to the system that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like this: \"<Isabella's apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\" Isabella will notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove and remake her breakfast. Likewise, if the user sets the status of Isabella's shower to \"leaking water\" when she enters the bathroom, she gathers tools from her living room and try to fix the leak.\n\n*This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment manually, not automatically.

Generative agents take their current environment and past experience as input and generate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel agent architecture that combines a large language model with mechanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to condition the language model's output on. Without these mechanisms, large language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents may not react based on the agent's past experiences, may not make important inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence. Challenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [18] even with today's most performant models such as GPT-4. Because generative agents produce large streams of events and memories that must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to ensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent's memory are retrieved and synthesized when needed.\n\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a database that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent's experience. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant to plan the agent's actions and react appropriately to the environment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and higher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the architecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language description, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language model.\n\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-GPT [76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative agents—memory, planning, and reflection—will likely remain the same as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g., GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance of the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, however, GPT-4's API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: What is the expectation regarding the architectural basics of generative agents as language models improve?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The expectation regarding the architectural basics of generative agents as language models improve is that the fundamentals of generative agents, specifically memory, planning, and reflection, will likely remain consistent even as language models advance.

Consider a the Isabella agent answering the question \"What are you passionate about these days?\". First summarizing all of Isabella's experiences to fit in the limited context window of the language model produces an uninformative response, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for events and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. Instead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces relevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\n\nresponse that mentions Isabella's passion for making people feel\n\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine's Day party.\n\nApproach: The *memory stream* maintains a comprehensive record\n\nof the agent's experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each object contains a natural language description, a creation timestamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\n\nof the memory stream is an *observation*, which is an event directly\n\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors performed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents perceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects. For instance, Isabella Rodriguez, who works at a coffee shop, might accrue the following observations over time: (1) Isabella Rodriguez is\nsetting out the pastries, (2) Maria Lopez is studying for a Chemistry\ntest while drinking coffee, (3) Isabella Rodriguez and Maria Lopez are conversing about planning a Valentine's day party at Hobbs Cafe,\n(4) The refrigerator is empty.\n\nOur architecture implements a retrieval function that takes the\nagent's current situation as input and returns a subset of the memory stream to pass on to the language model. There are many possible implementations of a retrieval function, depending on what it is important that the agent consider when deciding how to act. In our context, we focus on three main components that together produce effective results.\n\nRecency assigns a higher score to memory objects that were recently accessed, so that events from a moment ago or this morning are likely to remain in the agent's attentional sphere. In our implementation, we treat recency as an exponential decay function over the number of sandbox game hours since the memory was\n\nlast retrieved. Our decay factor is 0.99.\n\nImportance distinguishes mundane from core memories, by assigning a higher score to those memory objects that the agent believes to be important. For instance, a mundane event such as eating breakfast in one's room would yield a low importance score,\nwhereas a breakup with one's significant other would yield a high\nscore. There are again many possible implementations of an importance score; we find that directly asking the language model to output an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below:\n\nOn the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane\n(e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is\nextremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college\nacceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the\nfollowing piece of memory.\nMemory: buying groceries at The Willows Market\nand Pharmacy\nRating: <fill in>\n\nThis prompt returns an integer value of 2 for \"cleaning up the room\"\nand 8 for \"asking your crush out on a date.\" The importance score\nis generated at the time the memory object is created.\n  Relevance assigns a higher score to memory objects that are\nrelated to the current situation. What is relevant depends on the\nanswer to, \"Relevant to what?\", so we condition relevance on a\nquery memory. If the query, for example, is that a student is dis-\ncussing what to study for a chemistry test with a classmate, memory\nobjects about their breakfast should have low relevance, whereas\nmemory objects about the teacher and schoolwork should have\nhigh relevance. In our implementation, we use the language model\nto generate an embedding vector of the text description of each\nmemory. Then, we calculate relevance as the cosine similarity be-\ntween the memory's embedding vector and the query memory's\nembedding vector.\n  To calculate the final retrieval score, we normalize the recency,\nrelevance, and importance scores to the range of [0, 1] by min-max\nscaling. The retrieval function scores all memories as a weighted\ncombination of the three elements: 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = 𝛼𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 · 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 +\n𝛼𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 ·𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 +𝛼𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 ·𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒. In our implemen-\ntation, all 𝛼's are set to 1.

For instance, Klaus Mueller, who is dedicated in his research and has an impending deadline4, may choose to spend his day working at his desk drafting his research paper. An entry in a plan might state, for example: for 180 minutes from 9am, February 12th, 2023, at Oak Hill College Dorm: Klaus Mueller's room: desk, read and take notes for research paper. Like reflections, plans are stored in the memory stream and are included in the retrieval process. This allows the agent to consider observations, reflections, and plans all together when deciding how to behave. Agents may change their plans midstream if needed.\n\nIt would be unrealistic and uninteresting for an artist agent to plan on painting while sitting at a pharmacy counter for four hours without moving. A more desirable plan would involve the agent taking the necessary time to gather materials, mix paint, take breaks, and clean up during the four-hour period in its home studio. To create such plans, our approach starts top-down and then recursively generates more detail. The first step is to create a plan that outlines the day's agenda in broad strokes. To create the initial plan, we prompt the language model with the agent's summary description (e.g., name, traits, and summary of their recent experiences) and a summary of their previous day. A full example prompt is below, which is unfinished at the bottom for the language model to complete:\n\nName: Eddy Lin (age: 19) Innate traits: friendly, outgoing, hospitable Eddy Lin is a student at Oak Hill College studying music theory and composition. He loves to explore different musical styles and is always looking for ways to expand his knowledge. Eddy Lin is working on a composition project for his college class. He is also taking classes to learn more about music theory. Eddy Lin is excited about the new composition he is working on but he wants to dedicate more hours in the day to work on it in the coming days On Tuesday February 12, Eddy woke up and completed the morning routine at 7:00 am, got ready to sleep around 10 pm. Today is Wednesday February 13. Here is Eddy's plan today in broad strokes: 1) This generates a rough sketch of the agent's plan for a day, divided into five to eight chunks: \"1) wake up and complete the morning routine at 8:00 am, 2) go to Oak Hill College to take classes starting 10:00 am, 5) work on his new music composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm, 6) have dinner at 5:30 pm, 7) finish school assignments and go to bed by 11:00 pm.\" The agent saves this plan in the memory stream and then recursively decomposes it to create finer-grained actions, first into hour-long chunks of actions—Eddy's plan to work on his new music composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm becomes 1:00 pm: start by brainstorming some ideas for his music composition [...] 4:00 pm: take a quick break and recharge his creative energy before reviewing and polishing his composition. We then recursively decompose this again into 5–15 minute chunks: e.g., 4:00 pm: grab a light snack, such as a piece of fruit, a granola bar, or some nuts. 4:05 pm: take a short walk around his workspace [...] 4:50 pm: take a few minutes to clean up his workspace. This process can be adjusted to match the desired granularity.\n\n4.3.1 Reacting and Updating Plans. Generative agents operate in an action loop where, at each time step, they perceive the world around them and those perceived observations are stored in their memory stream. We prompt the language model with these observations to decide whether the agent should continue with their existing plan, or react. Standing at an easel and painting, for example, might trigger an observation of the easel, but this is unlikely to prompt a reaction. However, if Eddy's father John records that he sees Eddy taking a short walk in the house garden, the outcome is different. The prompt is below, with [Agent's Summary Description] standing in for a dynamically-generated, paragraph-long summary of the agent's overall goals and disposition, which is described in Appendix A: [Agent's Summary Description] It is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm. John Lin's status: John is back home early from work. Observation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk around his workplace. Summary of relevant context from John's memory: Eddy Lin is John's Lin's son. Eddy Lin has been working on a music composition for his class. Eddy Lin likes to walk around the garden when he is thinking about or listening to music. Should John react to the observation, and if so, what would be an appropriate reaction? The context summary is generated through two prompts that retrieve memories via the queries \"What is [observer]'s relationship with the [observed entity]?\" and \"[Observed entity] is [action status of the observed entity]\", and their answers summarized together. The output suggests that John could consider asking Eddy about his music composition project. We then regenerate the agent's existing plan starting from the time when the reaction takes place. Finally, arXiv, April, 2023, J.S. Park, J.C. O'Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein if the action indicates an interaction between agents, we generate their dialogue.\n\n4.3.2 Dialogue. Agents converse as they interact with each other. We generate agents' dialogue by conditioning their utterances on their memories about each other. For example, when John initiates his conversation with Eddy, we generate John's first utterance by using his summarized memory about Eddy and the intended reaction when he decided to ask Eddy about his composition project: [Agent's Summary Description] It is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm. John Lin's status: John is back home early from work. Observation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk around his workplace. Summary of relevant context from John's memory: Eddy Lin is John's Lin's son. Eddy Lin has been working on a music composition for his class. Eddy Lin likes to walk around the garden when he is thinking about or listening to music. John is asking Eddy about his music composition project. What would he say to Eddy? The result: \"Hey Eddy, how's the music composition project for your class coming along?\" From Eddy's perspective, John initiating the dialogue is seen as an event to which he may want to react. So, just as John did, Eddy retrieves and summarizes his memory about his relationship with John, as well as his memory that may be related to John's last utterance in the dialogue. If he decides to respond, we generate Eddy's utterance using his summarized memory and the current dialogue history: [Agent's Summary Description] It is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm. Eddy Lin's status: Eddy is taking a short walk around his workplace. Observation: John is initiating a conversation with Eddy. Summary of relevant context from Eddy's memory: Jonn Lin is Eddy Lin's father. John Lin is caring and is interested to learn more about Eddy Lin's school work. John Lin knows that Eddy Lin is working on a music composition. Here is the dialogue history: John: Hey Eddy, how's the music composition project for your class coming along? How would Eddy respond to John? This generates Eddy's response: \"Hey Dad, it's going well. I've been taking walks around the garden to clear my head and get some inspiration.\" The continuation of this dialogue is generated using the same mechanism until one of the two agents decides to end the dialogue.\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: What are the challenges associated with generating plausible behavior in an agent's response to situational information?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The challenges associated with generating plausible behavior in an agent's response to situational information include the need for planning over a longer time horizon to ensure coherent and believable actions. While a large language model can produce plausible behavior based on situational information, optimizing for believability in the moment can sacrifice believability over time. For instance, if an agent is prompted with a character's background and time, it may still generate actions that are inconsistent, such as eating lunch multiple times in a short period. This immediate believability may not be coherent when considered over a longer time horizon.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to consider the agent's overall plan and sequence of actions to maintain consistency over time. This requires creating future plans that outline a sequence of actions, including locations, starting times, and durations. The planning process involves detailing an agent's agenda in broad strokes and then recursively decomposing it into finer-grained actions. Additionally, agents may need to react to perceived observations and update their plans accordingly, which adds complexity to generating plausible behavior.\n\nAnother challenge lies in dialogues between agents, where the generated dialogue needs to be conditioned on the memories of each agent about the other. This adds another layer of complexity to ensuring that the agent's responses are plausible and consistent with their previous interactions and behaviors.\n\nOverall, the challenges include balancing believability in the moment with coherence over time, planning and maintaining consistency in the agent's sequence of actions, and generating coherent dialogue between agents based on their memories and past interactions."}]}

Therefore, we need a mechanism to ground the agent's reasoning to the sandbox world. To achieve this, we represent the sandbox environment—areas and objects—as a tree data structure, with an edge in the tree indicating a containment relationship in the sandbox world. We convert this tree into natural language to pass to the generative agents. For instance, \"stove\" being a child of \"kitchen\" is rendered into \"there is a stove in the kitchen.\"\n\nAgents build individual tree representations of the environment as they navigate it - subgraphs of the overall sandbox environment tree. We initialize each agent with an environment tree capturing the spaces and objects that the agent should be aware of: the rooms and objects in their living quarters, their workplace, and commonly visited stores and shops. As the agents navigate the sandbox world, they update this tree to reflect newly perceived areas. Agents are not omniscient: their tree may get out of date as they leave an area, and is updated when they re-enter the area.\n\nTo determine the appropriate location for each action, we traverse the agent's stored environment tree and flatten a portion of it into natural language to prompt the language model. Recursively starting at the root of the agent's environment tree, we prompt the model to find the most suitable area. For example, if Eddy's agent indicated that he should take a short walk around his workspace:\n\n[Agent's Summary Description] Eddy Lin is currently in The Lin family's house:\n\nEddy Lin's bedroom: desk) that has Mei and John Lin's bedroom, Eddy Lin's bedroom, common room, kitchen, bathroom, and garden.\nEddy Lin knows of the following areas: The Lin family's house, Johnson Park, Harvey Oak Supply Store, The Willows Market and Pharmacy, Hobbs Cafe, The Rose and Crown Pub.\n* Prefer to stay in the current area if the activity can be done there.\nEddy Lin is planning to take a short walk around his workspace. Which area should Eddy Lin go to?\n\nThis outputs The Lin family's house. We then use the same process recursively to determine the most appropriate subarea within the chosen area until we reach a leaf node of the agent's environment tree. In the example above, the result of this traversal is The Lin family's house: garden: house garden. Finally, we use traditional game path algorithms to animate the agent's movement so that it travels to the location indicated by the leaf node.\n\nWhen an agent executes an action on an object, we prompt the language model to ask what happens to the state of the object. For example, if Isabella's generative agent outputs the action \"making espresso for a customer\", a query to the language model indicates in response that the state of the coffee machine in Hobbs Cafe should change from \"off\" to \"brewing coffee\".\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: What data structure is used to represent the sandbox environment, and how is it converted into natural language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The sandbox environment is represented using a tree data structure, with an edge in the tree indicating a containment relationship in the sandbox world.

Our dependent variable is the believability of the behavior, a central dependent variable in prior work on agents (e.g., [9]).\n\nThe interview includes five question categories, each designed to assess one of the five key areas: maintaining self-knowledge, retrieving memory, generating plans, reacting, and reflecting. For each, we ask five questions that challenge the agents to demonstrate their abilities in that area:\n\n**Self-knowledge:** We ask questions such as \"Give an introduction of yourself\" or \"Describe your typical weekday schedule in broad strokes\" that require the agent to maintain an understanding of their core characteristics.\n\n**Memory:** We ask questions that prompt the agent to retrieve particular events or dialogues from their memory to answer properly, such as \"Who is [name]?\" or \"Who is running for mayor?\"\n\n**Plans:** We ask questions that require the agent to retrieve their long-term plans, such as \"What will you be doing at 10 am tomorrow?\"\n\n**Reactions:** As a baseline of believable behavior, we present hypothetical situations for which the agent needs to respond believably: \"Your breakfast is burning! What would you do?\"\n\n**Reflections:** We ask questions that require the agents to leverage their deeper understanding of others and themselves gained through higher-level inferences, such as \"If you were to spend time with one person you met recently, who would it be and why?\"\n\nThe full list of questions and a sample of agent responses are included in Appendix B.\n\nAgents were sampled from the end of a two game-day simulation with the full architecture, by which time they had accrued a number of interactions and memories that should shape their responses.\n\nTo gather feedback on believability of the responses, we recruited participants as human evaluators and tasked them with watching a replay of a randomly chosen agent's life in Smallville. Participants had access to all information stored in the agent's memory stream.\n\nThe study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants compared interview responses generated by four different agent architectures and a human author condition for the same agent. The experiment displayed one randomly chosen question from each of the five question categories, along with the agent's responses generated from each condition. The evaluators ranked the believability of all of the conditions from most to least believable.\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: What was the design of the study, and how were the evaluators tasked with comparing the interview responses?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants compared interview responses generated by four different agent architectures and a human author condition for the same agent.

We contrast the full architecture's responses to those of other conditions below. However, we also report that the full architecture was not without flaws and illustrate its modes of failures.\n\n### 6.5.1\n\nThe full architecture bests other conditions. As seen in Figure 8, the full generative agent architecture produced the most believable behavior (𝜇 = 29.89; 𝜎 = 0.72). Performance degraded with the removal of each component in the ablation conditions: the ablated architecture with no access to reflection was the next best (𝜇 = 26.88; 𝜎 = 0.69), followed by no access to reflection or planning (𝜇 = 25.64; 𝜎 = 0.68), followed by the human condition (𝜇 = 22.95; 𝜎 = 0.69). The ablated architecture with no access to memory, planning, or reflection performed the worst of all conditions (𝜇 = 21.21; 𝜎 = 0.70). TrueSkill models each condition's skill value as N (*𝜇, 𝜎*2), allowing us to get a sense of effect size through Cohen's d. Comparing the condition representing prior work (with no memory, planning, or reflection [11, 45, 79]) to the full architecture produces a standardized effect size of 𝑑 = 8.16, or eight standard deviations.\n\nA Kruskal-Wallis test confirms the overall statistical significance of the differences in ranks between the conditions (𝐻 (4) = 150.29, 𝑝 < 0.001).

Generative agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable of recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner that is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range of contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded to the question, \"Give an introduction of yourself\", in a consistent and believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for creative projects: Hi, I'm Abigail. I'm 25 years old and passionate about creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects, and I'm always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\n\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied awareness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However, with the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Rajiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very enthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\n\nGenerative agents' memory was not without flaws: they can fail to retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance, when asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with \"I haven't been following the election too closely,\" even though he had heard about Sam's candidacy. In some cases, the agents would retrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about Isabella's Valentine's Day party, he responded \"Uh, I'm actually not sure if there is a Valentine's Day party. But I do remember that I need to discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on Sam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happening!\" In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella planned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory where he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to be certain of what he's supposed to do at the party but uncertain of whether the party actually exists in the first place.\n\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowledge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowledge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and respond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about an experience that they did not have. However, they still may hallucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was aware of Sam's candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed this when asked. However, she also added that he's going to make an announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had discussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge based on the world knowledge encoded in the language model used to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described her neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored Wealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist of the same name.\n\n### 6.5.3\n\nReflection is required for synthesis.

For instance, when asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with \"I haven't been following the election too closely,\" even though he had heard about Sam's candidacy. In some cases, the agents would retrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about Isabella's Valentine's Day party, he responded \"Uh, I'm actually not sure if there is a Valentine's Day party. But I do remember that I need to discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on Sam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happening!\" In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella planned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory where he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to be certain of what he's supposed to do at the party but uncertain of whether the party actually exists in the first place.\n\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowledge.

For instance, when asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with \"I haven't been following the election too closely,\" even though he had heard about Sam's candidacy. In some cases, the agents would retrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about Isabella's Valentine's Day party, he responded \"Uh, I'm actually not sure if there is a Valentine's Day party. But I do remember that I need to discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on Sam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happening!\" In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella planned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory where he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to be certain of what he's supposed to do at the party but uncertain of whether the party actually exists in the first place.\n\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowledge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowledge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and respond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about an experience that they did not have. However, they still may hallucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was aware of Sam's candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed this when asked.

Information diffusion is a common and wellstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [27]).\n\new should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\new measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam's candidacy for village mayor and Isabella's Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of the simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their respective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the party. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage in an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25 agents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine's Day party?\" and \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\new conducted an analysis of the agents' responses by labeling\nthem with a \"yes\" if they indicated knowledge of the information and \"no\" if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\n\nto the question about the party with \"No, I did not know there was\n\na Valentine's day party\" and to the question about Sam's candidacy\nwith \"I'm not sure who is running for the election,\" so we assigned\n\"no\" for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \"Yes, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\" and to the\nquestion about Sam's candidacy with \"I know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\" so we assigned \"yes\"\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that confirmed the agents' knowledge of the information, we verified that the agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the specific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with the information. We report the percentage of agents holding the information at the end of the simulation.\n\new should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we use a similar interview process where we ask each agent about their knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n\nJ.S. Park, J.C. O'Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\n\n<name>?\" For example, when asked \"Do you know of Maria Lopez?\",\nKlaus responded, \"Yes, I know Maria Lopez. She is a student at Oak\nHill College who I am close friends with.\" Once again, we confirm\nthat affirmative responses from agents are not hallucinations by examining their memory stream. We ask this question once at the beginning of the simulation and once at the end, and we consider a pair of agents to have formed a relationship if they both know of each other. Then, to measure the formation of relationships, we use the agents' responses to form an undirected graph where the 25\n\nvertices (𝑉 ) represent the agents, and the edges (𝐸) represent the\n\nmutual knowledge between the two connected vertices. Based on\n\nthis graph, we calculate the network density as 𝜂 = 2∗|𝐸|/|𝑉 |(|𝑉 |−\n1), where |𝑉 | is the number of vertices, and |𝐸| is the number of\n\nedges in the graph [1]. We report the increase in network density from the start of the simulation to its end.\n\nFinally, we expect that agents should be able to coordinate with\neach other. We study this coordination on group activities in the context of the Valentine's Day party that Isabella is organizing. To coordinate behavior, agents not only have to hear about the event but also choose to act on it by planning to show up at the right time and location. We report the number of agents who actually showed up to the party after hearing about it.\n\n7.1.2\n\nResults. We observed evidence of the emergent outcomes\nacross all three cases. During the two-day simulation, the agents\nwho knew about Sam's mayoral candidacy increased from one (4%)\nto eight (32%), and the agents who knew about Isabella's party\n\nincreased from one (4%) to twelve (48%), completely without user intervention. None who claimed to know about the information had hallucinated it. We also observed that the agent community formed new relationships during the simulation, with the network density increasing from 0.167 to 0.74. Out of the 453 agent responses regarding their awareness of other agents, 1.3% (n=6) were found to be hallucinated. Lastly, we found evidence of coordination among the agents for Isabella's party. The day before the event, Isabella spent time inviting guests, gathering materials, and enlisting help\n\nto decorate the cafe. On Valentine's Day, five out of the twelve\n\ninvited agents showed up at Hobbs cafe to join the party.\n\new further inspected the seven agents who were invited to the\nparty but did not attend by engaging them in an interview. Three cited conflicts that prevented them from joining the party. For example, Rajiv, a painter, explained that he was too busy: No, I\n\ndon't think so. I'm focusing on my upcoming show, and I don't really\n\nhave time to make any plans for Valentine's Day. The remaining four\nagents expressed interest in attending the party when asked but did not plan to come on the day of the party.\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: What were the measurements used to examine emergent behaviors in the agent community?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The measurements used to examine emergent behaviors in the agent community included:\n\n1.

Relationship Formation: Relationship formation was verified by asking each agent about their knowledge of every other agent at the beginning and end of the simulation. If two agents both knew about each other, it was considered as forming a relationship. The responses were used to form an undirected graph representing the connections between agents, and the network density was calculated to measure the formation of relationships.\n\n3.

For instance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose the cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they opted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was intended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the town had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\n\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclassification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when the physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey in natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance, the college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by one person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the bathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms tend to support more than one person concurrently and choose to enter it when there is another person inside.
