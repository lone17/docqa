For instance, agents who initially chose the cafe for lunch later opted to go to a nearby bar for lunch, even though the bar was intended to be a get-together location for later in the day. This is a consequence of the challenge in determining the appropriate space to execute an action, given the increasing number of locations that the agent learned about."}]}

For instance, agents assumed that the college dorm's bathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms tend to support more than one person concurrently. This misinterpretation of the bathroom's occupancy led to agents entering the bathroom when it was already occupied by another person, causing a breach of the proper behavior expected in that location."}]}
