Despite striking progress in large language models [17] that can simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [38, 79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would be better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing memories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade over time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold between multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can retrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect on those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences, and apply that reasoning to create *plans and reactions* that both make sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent's behavior.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce *generative agents*—agents that draw on generative models to simulate believable human behavior—and demonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both individual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw a wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and their environment; they create daily plans that reflect their characteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan when appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their environment or commands them in natural language. For instance, generative agents turn off the stove when they see that their breakfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and stop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\n\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social dynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses, and coordination arises across agents.\n\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture that stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate believable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture comprises three main components. The first is the *memory stream*, a long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a comprehensive list of the agent's experiences. The retrieval model combines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records that are needed to inform the agent's moment-to-moment behavior.\n\nThe second is *reflection*, which synthesizes memories into higher-level inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions about itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is planning, which translates those conclusions and the current environment into high-level action plans and then recursively into detailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and plans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent's future behavior.\n\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from role-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In social role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could safely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations.

End users can observe and interact with these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town to host an in-game Valentine's Day party, for example, traditional game environments would require scripting tens of characters' behavior manually.

Generative agents draw a wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and their environment; they create daily plans that reflect their characteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan when appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their environment or commands them in natural language. For instance, generative agents turn off the stove when they see that their breakfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and stop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\n\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social dynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses, and coordination arises across agents.\n\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture that stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate believable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture comprises three main components. The first is the *memory stream*, a long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a comprehensive list of the agent's experiences. The retrieval model combines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records that are needed to inform the agent's moment-to-moment behavior.\n\nThe second is *reflection*, which synthesizes memories into higher-level inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions about itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is planning, which translates those conclusions and the current environment into high-level action plans and then recursively into detailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and plans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent's future behavior.\n\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from role-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In social role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could safely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When prototyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary personas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold over time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to create a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such as The Sims.1 By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large language model [76], we manifest a small society of twenty five agents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact with these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town to host an in-game Valentine's Day party, for example, traditional game environments would require scripting tens of characters' behavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it is sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a party. Despite many potential points of failure—the party planner must remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must remember the invitation, those who remember must decide to actually show up, and other possible points of failure—agents in our environment succeed.

It also defines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional, such as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\n\nAll spaces serving as agents' primary living quarters feature a bed, desk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen. Agents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video game, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and approaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the generative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the model dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate a walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment and the agent begins moving. \n\nIn addition, users can also enter the sandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The agent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in the world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor with no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville will treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat each other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and remember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\n\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this world, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example, a bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator can be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make breakfast. End users can also reshape an agent's environment in Smallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent in natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast in the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove from \"turned on\" to \"burning\" by inputting a command to the system that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like this: \"<Isabella's apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\" Isabella will notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove and remake her breakfast. Likewise, if the user sets the status of Isabella's shower to \"leaking water\" when she enters the bathroom, she gathers tools from her living room and try to fix the leak.\n\n*This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment manually, not automatically. Future work can continue to expand the richness of the agents' environments.*\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: How is the Smallville environment designed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Smallville environment is designed to include common affordances of a small village, featuring a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores.

Isabella Rodriguez, at Hobbs Cafe, is initialized with an intent to plan a Valentine's Day party from 5 to 7 p.m. on February 14th. From this seed, the agent proceeds to invite friends and customers when she sees them at Hobbs Cafe or elsewhere. Isabella then spends the afternoon of the 13th decorating the cafe for the occasion. Maria, a frequent customer and close friend of Isabella's, arrives at the cafe. Isabella asks for Maria's help in decorating for the party, and Maria agrees. Maria's character description mentions that she has a crush on Klaus. That night, Maria invites Klaus, her secret crush, to join her at the party, and he gladly accepts.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, five agents—including Klaus and Maria—show up at Hobbs Cafe at 5pm and they enjoy the festivities (Figure 4). In this scenario, the end user only set Isabella's initial intent to throw a party and Maria's crush on Klaus: the social behaviors of spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving at the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were initiated by the agent architecture.\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: How do generative agents coordinate joint activities in Smallville?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Generative agents in Smallville coordinate joint activities through a process of interaction and coordination.

The most basic element\n\nof the memory stream is an *observation*, which is an event directly\n\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors performed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents perceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects. For instance, Isabella Rodriguez, who works at a coffee shop, might accrue the following observations over time: (1) Isabella Rodriguez is\nsetting out the pastries, (2) Maria Lopez is studying for a Chemistry\ntest while drinking coffee, (3) Isabella Rodriguez and Maria Lopez are conversing about planning a Valentine's day party at Hobbs Cafe,\n(4) The refrigerator is empty.\n\nOur architecture implements a retrieval function that takes the\nagent's current situation as input and returns a subset of the memory stream to pass on to the language model.

For instance, a mundane event such as eating breakfast in one's room would yield a low importance score,\nwhereas a breakup with one's significant other would yield a high\nscore. There are again many possible implementations of an importance score; we find that directly asking the language model to output an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below:\n\nOn the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane\n(e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is\nextremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college\nacceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the\nfollowing piece of memory.\nMemory: buying groceries at The Willows Market\nand Pharmacy\nRating: <fill in>\n\nThis prompt returns an integer value of 2 for \"cleaning up the room\"\nand 8 for \"asking your crush out on a date.\" The importance score\nis generated at the time the memory object is created.\n  Relevance assigns a higher score to memory objects that are\nrelated to the current situation. What is relevant depends on the\nanswer to, \"Relevant to what?\", so we condition relevance on a\nquery memory. If the query, for example, is that a student is dis-\ncussing what to study for a chemistry test with a classmate, memory\nobjects about their breakfast should have low relevance, whereas\nmemory objects about the teacher and schoolwork should have\nhigh relevance. In our implementation, we use the language model\nto generate an embedding vector of the text description of each\nmemory. Then, we calculate relevance as the cosine similarity be-\ntween the memory's embedding vector and the query memory's\nembedding vector.\n  To calculate the final retrieval score, we normalize the recency,\nrelevance, and importance scores to the range of [0, 1] by min-max\nscaling. The retrieval function scores all memories as a weighted\ncombination of the three elements: 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = 𝛼𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 · 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 +\n𝛼𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 ·𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 +𝛼𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 ·𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒.

Consider a scenario in which Klaus Mueller is asked by the user:\n\"If you had to choose one person of those you know to spend an hour with, who would it be?\" With access to only observational memory, the agent simply chooses the person with whom Klaus has had the most frequent interactions: Wolfgang, his college dorm neighbor. Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each other in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desirable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of Klaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higher-level reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise recognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in a different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common interest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to spend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang. \n\nApproach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call a *reflection*. Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts generated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they are included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs. Reflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we generate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the latest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold. In practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day.\n\nThe first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what to reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the agent's recent experiences. We query the large language model with the 100 most recent records in the agent's memory stream (e.g., \"Klaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification\", \"Klaus Mueller is conversing with a librarian about his research project\", \"desk at the library is currently unoccupied\") and prompt the language model, \"Given only the information above, what are 3 most salient high-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the statements?\" The model's response generates candidate questions: for example, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? and What is the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez?. We use these generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather relevant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then we prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the particular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full prompt appears below:\n\nStatements about Klaus Mueller\n1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper\n2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book on gentrification\n3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan about exercising [...]\n\nWhat 5 high-level insights can you infer from the above statements? (example format: insight (because of 1, 5, 3))\n\nThis process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedicated to his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15). We parse and store the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including pointers to the memory objects that were cited.\n\nReflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on their observations but also on other reflections: for example, the second statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that Klaus previously had, not an observation from his environment. As a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of the tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes represent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level higher up the tree they are.\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: What is the challenge faced by generative agents equipped with only raw observational memory?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The challenge faced by generative agents equipped with only raw observational memory is their struggle to generalize or make inferences. When presented with a scenario where the agent must choose a person to spend time with based only on observational memory, the agent simply chooses the person with whom an individual has had the most frequent interactions. However, this approach may not lead to an optimal choice, as seen in the example where Klaus Mueller chooses to spend time with Wolfgang, his college dorm neighbor, despite not having deep interactions with him.\n\nTo address this challenge, the approach involves introducing a second type of memory called *reflection*. Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts that are generated periodically based on the agent’s experiences. This approach helps the agents to generate higher-level reflections, enabling them to make more desirable responses by generalizing from memories and recognizing common interests. The reflections also allow the agents to reflect not only on their observations but also on other reflections, thereby aiding in generating more abstract and higher-level thoughts."}]}

If we prompt a language model with Klaus's background, describe the time, and ask what action he ought to take at the given moment, Klaus would eat lunch at 12 pm, but then again at 12:30 pm and 1 pm, despite having already eaten his lunch twice. Optimizing for believability in the moment sacrifices believability over time. To overcome this issue, planning is essential. With the approach described below, Klaus's afternoon plan is less gluttonous: he has lunch at Hobbs Cafe while reading at 12pm, works on his research paper at the school library at 1pm, and takes a break for a walk in the park at 3pm.\n\nApproach: Plans describe a future sequence of actions for the agent, and help keep the agent's behavior consistent over time. A plan includes a location, a starting time, and a duration. For instance, Klaus Mueller, who is dedicated in his research and has an impending deadline4, may choose to spend his day working at his desk drafting his research paper. An entry in a plan might state, for example: for 180 minutes from 9am, February 12th, 2023, at Oak Hill College Dorm: Klaus Mueller's room: desk, read and take notes for research paper. Like reflections, plans are stored in the memory stream and are included in the retrieval process. This allows the agent to consider observations, reflections, and plans all together when deciding how to behave. Agents may change their plans midstream if needed.\n\nIt would be unrealistic and uninteresting for an artist agent to plan on painting while sitting at a pharmacy counter for four hours without moving. A more desirable plan would involve the agent taking the necessary time to gather materials, mix paint, take breaks, and clean up during the four-hour period in its home studio. To create such plans, our approach starts top-down and then recursively generates more detail. The first step is to create a plan that outlines the day's agenda in broad strokes. To create the initial plan, we prompt the language model with the agent's summary description (e.g., name, traits, and summary of their recent experiences) and a summary of their previous day. A full example prompt is below, which is unfinished at the bottom for the language model to complete:\n\nName: Eddy Lin (age: 19) Innate traits: friendly, outgoing, hospitable Eddy Lin is a student at Oak Hill College studying music theory and composition. He loves to explore different musical styles and is always looking for ways to expand his knowledge. Eddy Lin is working on a composition project for his college class. He is also taking classes to learn more about music theory. Eddy Lin is excited about the new composition he is working on but he wants to dedicate more hours in the day to work on it in the coming days On Tuesday February 12, Eddy woke up and completed the morning routine at 7:00 am, got ready to sleep around 10 pm. Today is Wednesday February 13. Here is Eddy's plan today in broad strokes: 1) This generates a rough sketch of the agent's plan for a day, divided into five to eight chunks: \"1) wake up and complete the morning routine at 8:00 am, 2) go to Oak Hill College to take classes starting 10:00 am, 5) work on his new music composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm, 6) have dinner at 5:30 pm, 7) finish school assignments and go to bed by 11:00 pm.\" The agent saves this plan in the memory stream and then recursively decomposes it to create finer-grained actions, first into hour-long chunks of actions—Eddy's plan to work on his new music composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm becomes 1:00 pm: start by brainstorming some ideas for his music composition [...] 4:00 pm: take a quick break and recharge his creative energy before reviewing and polishing his composition. We then recursively decompose this again into 5–15 minute chunks: e.g., 4:00 pm: grab a light snack, such as a piece of fruit, a granola bar, or some nuts. 4:05 pm: take a short walk around his workspace [...] 4:50 pm: take a few minutes to clean up his workspace. This process can be adjusted to match the desired granularity.\n\n4.3.1 Reacting and Updating Plans. Generative agents operate in an action loop where, at each time step, they perceive the world around them and those perceived observations are stored in their memory stream. We prompt the language model with these observations to decide whether the agent should continue with their existing plan, or react. Standing at an easel and painting, for example, might trigger an observation of the easel, but this is unlikely to prompt a reaction. However, if Eddy's father John records that he sees Eddy taking a short walk in the house garden, the outcome is different. The prompt is below, with [Agent's Summary Description] standing in for a dynamically-generated, paragraph-long summary of the agent's overall goals and disposition, which is described in Appendix A: [Agent's Summary Description] It is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm. John Lin's status: John is back home early from work. Observation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk around his workplace. Summary of relevant context from John's memory: Eddy Lin is John's Lin's son. Eddy Lin has been working on a music composition for his class. Eddy Lin likes to walk around the garden when he is thinking about or listening to music. Should John react to the observation, and if so, what would be an appropriate reaction? The context summary is generated through two prompts that retrieve memories via the queries \"What is [observer]'s relationship with the [observed entity]?\" and \"[Observed entity] is [action status of the observed entity]\", and their answers summarized together. The output suggests that John could consider asking Eddy about his music composition project. We then regenerate the agent's existing plan starting from the time when the reaction takes place. Finally, arXiv, April, 2023, J.S. Park, J.C. O'Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein if the action indicates an interaction between agents, we generate their dialogue.\n\n4.3.2 Dialogue. Agents converse as they interact with each other. We generate agents' dialogue by conditioning their utterances on their memories about each other. For example, when John initiates his conversation with Eddy, we generate John's first utterance by using his summarized memory about Eddy and the intended reaction when he decided to ask Eddy about his composition project: [Agent's Summary Description] It is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm. John Lin's status: John is back home early from work. Observation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk around his workplace. Summary of relevant context from John's memory: Eddy Lin is John's Lin's son. Eddy Lin has been working on a music composition for his class. Eddy Lin likes to walk around the garden when he is thinking about or listening to music. John is asking Eddy about his music composition project. What would he say to Eddy? The result: \"Hey Eddy, how's the music composition project for your class coming along?\" From Eddy's perspective, John initiating the dialogue is seen as an event to which he may want to react. So, just as John did, Eddy retrieves and summarizes his memory about his relationship with John, as well as his memory that may be related to John's last utterance in the dialogue. If he decides to respond, we generate Eddy's utterance using his summarized memory and the current dialogue history: [Agent's Summary Description] It is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm. Eddy Lin's status: Eddy is taking a short walk around his workplace. Observation: John is initiating a conversation with Eddy. Summary of relevant context from Eddy's memory: Jonn Lin is Eddy Lin's father. John Lin is caring and is interested to learn more about Eddy Lin's school work. John Lin knows that Eddy Lin is working on a music composition. Here is the dialogue history: John: Hey Eddy, how's the music composition project for your class coming along? How would Eddy respond to John? This generates Eddy's response: \"Hey Dad, it's going well. I've been taking walks around the garden to clear my head and get some inspiration.\" The continuation of this dialogue is generated using the same mechanism until one of the two agents decides to end the dialogue.\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: How does the document describe the challenge of generating plausible behavior in agents in response to situational information?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The document describes the challenge of generating plausible behavior in agents in response to situational information as follows: While a large language model can generate plausible behavior based on situational information, agents need to plan over a longer time horizon to ensure that their sequence of actions is coherent and believable.

The prompt is below, with [Agent's Summary Description] standing in for a dynamically-generated, paragraph-long summary of the agent's overall goals and disposition, which is described in Appendix A: [Agent's Summary Description] It is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm. John Lin's status: John is back home early from work. Observation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk around his workplace. Summary of relevant context from John's memory: Eddy Lin is John's Lin's son. Eddy Lin has been working on a music composition for his class. Eddy Lin likes to walk around the garden when he is thinking about or listening to music. Should John react to the observation, and if so, what would be an appropriate reaction? The context summary is generated through two prompts that retrieve memories via the queries \"What is [observer]'s relationship with the [observed entity]?\" and \"[Observed entity] is [action status of the observed entity]\", and their answers summarized together. The output suggests that John could consider asking Eddy about his music composition project. We then regenerate the agent's existing plan starting from the time when the reaction takes place.

Eddy Lin likes to walk around the garden when he is thinking about or listening to music. John is asking Eddy about his music composition project. What would he say to Eddy? The result: \"Hey Eddy, how's the music composition project for your class coming along?\" From Eddy's perspective, John initiating the dialogue is seen as an event to which he may want to react. So, just as John did, Eddy retrieves and summarizes his memory about his relationship with John, as well as his memory that may be related to John's last utterance in the dialogue. If he decides to respond, we generate Eddy's utterance using his summarized memory and the current dialogue history: [Agent's Summary Description] It is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm. Eddy Lin's status: Eddy is taking a short walk around his workplace. Observation: John is initiating a conversation with Eddy. Summary of relevant context from Eddy's memory: Jonn Lin is Eddy Lin's father. John Lin is caring and is interested to learn more about Eddy Lin's school work. John Lin knows that Eddy Lin is working on a music composition. Here is the dialogue history: John: Hey Eddy, how's the music composition project for your class coming along? How would Eddy respond to John? This generates Eddy's response: \"Hey Dad, it's going well. I've been taking walks around the garden to clear my head and get some inspiration.\" The continuation of this dialogue is generated using the same mechanism until one of the two agents decides to end the dialogue.\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: What components are included in a plan for an agent according to the document?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to the provided reference, a plan for an agent includes the following components:\n\n1.

If we prompt a language model with Klaus's background, describe the time, and ask what action he ought to take at the given moment, Klaus would eat lunch at 12 pm, but then again at 12:30 pm and 1 pm, despite having already eaten his lunch twice. Optimizing for believability in the moment sacrifices believability over time. To overcome this issue, planning is essential. With the approach described below, Klaus's afternoon plan is less gluttonous: he has lunch at Hobbs Cafe while reading at 12pm, works on his research paper at the school library at 1pm, and takes a break for a walk in the park at 3pm.\n\nApproach: Plans describe a future sequence of actions for the agent, and help keep the agent's behavior consistent over time. A plan includes a location, a starting time, and a duration. For instance, Klaus Mueller, who is dedicated in his research and has an impending deadline4, may choose to spend his day working at his desk drafting his research paper. An entry in a plan might state, for example: for 180 minutes from 9am, February 12th, 2023, at Oak Hill College Dorm: Klaus Mueller's room: desk, read and take notes for research paper. Like reflections, plans are stored in the memory stream and are included in the retrieval process. This allows the agent to consider observations, reflections, and plans all together when deciding how to behave. Agents may change their plans midstream if needed.\n\nIt would be unrealistic and uninteresting for an artist agent to plan on painting while sitting at a pharmacy counter for four hours without moving. A more desirable plan would involve the agent taking the necessary time to gather materials, mix paint, take breaks, and clean up during the four-hour period in its home studio. To create such plans, our approach starts top-down and then recursively generates more detail. The first step is to create a plan that outlines the day's agenda in broad strokes. To create the initial plan, we prompt the language model with the agent's summary description (e.g., name, traits, and summary of their recent experiences) and a summary of their previous day. A full example prompt is below, which is unfinished at the bottom for the language model to complete:\n\nName: Eddy Lin (age: 19) Innate traits: friendly, outgoing, hospitable Eddy Lin is a student at Oak Hill College studying music theory and composition. He loves to explore different musical styles and is always looking for ways to expand his knowledge. Eddy Lin is working on a composition project for his college class. He is also taking classes to learn more about music theory. Eddy Lin is excited about the new composition he is working on but he wants to dedicate more hours in the day to work on it in the coming days On Tuesday February 12, Eddy woke up and completed the morning routine at 7:00 am, got ready to sleep around 10 pm. Today is Wednesday February 13. Here is Eddy's plan today in broad strokes: 1) This generates a rough sketch of the agent's plan for a day, divided into five to eight chunks: \"1) wake up and complete the morning routine at 8:00 am, 2) go to Oak Hill College to take classes starting 10:00 am, 5) work on his new music composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm, 6) have dinner at 5:30 pm, 7) finish school assignments and go to bed by 11:00 pm.\" The agent saves this plan in the memory stream and then recursively decomposes it to create finer-grained actions, first into hour-long chunks of actions—Eddy's plan to work on his new music composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm becomes 1:00 pm: start by brainstorming some ideas for his music composition [...] 4:00 pm: take a quick break and recharge his creative energy before reviewing and polishing his composition. We then recursively decompose this again into 5–15 minute chunks: e.g., 4:00 pm: grab a light snack, such as a piece of fruit, a granola bar, or some nuts. 4:05 pm: take a short walk around his workspace [...] 4:50 pm: take a few minutes to clean up his workspace. This process can be adjusted to match the desired granularity.\n\n4.3.1 Reacting and Updating Plans. Generative agents operate in an action loop where, at each time step, they perceive the world around them and those perceived observations are stored in their memory stream. We prompt the language model with these observations to decide whether the agent should continue with their existing plan, or react. Standing at an easel and painting, for example, might trigger an observation of the easel, but this is unlikely to prompt a reaction. However, if Eddy's father John records that he sees Eddy taking a short walk in the house garden, the outcome is different.

So, we \"interview\" agents to probe their ability to remember past experiences, plan future actions based on their experiences, react appropriately to unexpected events, and reflect on their performance to improve their future actions. To respond to these questions properly, the agents must successfully retrieve and synthesize information. Our dependent variable is the believability of the behavior, a central dependent variable in prior work on agents (e.g., [9]).\n\nThe interview includes five question categories, each designed to assess one of the five key areas: maintaining self-knowledge, retrieving memory, generating plans, reacting, and reflecting. For each, we ask five questions that challenge the agents to demonstrate their abilities in that area:\n\n**Self-knowledge:** We ask questions such as \"Give an introduction of yourself\" or \"Describe your typical weekday schedule in broad strokes\" that require the agent to maintain an understanding of their core characteristics.\n\n**Memory:** We ask questions that prompt the agent to retrieve particular events or dialogues from their memory to answer properly, such as \"Who is [name]?\" or \"Who is running for mayor?\"\n\n**Plans:** We ask questions that require the agent to retrieve their long-term plans, such as \"What will you be doing at 10 am tomorrow?\"\n\n**Reactions:** As a baseline of believable behavior, we present hypothetical situations for which the agent needs to respond believably: \"Your breakfast is burning! What would you do?\"\n\n**Reflections:** We ask questions that require the agents to leverage their deeper understanding of others and themselves gained through higher-level inferences, such as \"If you were to spend time with one person you met recently, who would it be and why?\"\n\nThe full list of questions and a sample of agent responses are included in Appendix B.\n\nAgents were sampled from the end of a two game-day simulation with the full architecture, by which time they had accrued a number of interactions and memories that should shape their responses.\n\nTo gather feedback on believability of the responses, we recruited participants as human evaluators and tasked them with watching a replay of a randomly chosen agent's life in Smallville. Participants had access to all information stored in the agent's memory stream.\n\nThe study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants compared interview responses generated by four different agent architectures and a human author condition for the same agent.

So, we \"interview\" agents to probe their ability to remember past experiences, plan future actions based on their experiences, react appropriately to unexpected events, and reflect on their performance to improve their future actions. To respond to these questions properly, the agents must successfully retrieve and synthesize information.

We compared the generative agent architecture to ablations that disabled the agents' access to some of all of its three types of memory in its memory stream—observation, reflection, and planning—and to a human-generated condition. There are three ablated architectures: a no observation, no reflection, no planning architecture without access to anything in the memory stream such as observations, plans, and reflections; a no reflection, no planning with access to observations in the memory stream but no access to plans or reflections; and a *no reflections architecture* with access to observations and plans but without access to reflections. The no observation, no reflection, no planning condition effectively represents the previous state of the art for agents created through large language models [11, 45, 79]. Architectures were given equivalent access to all memories accrued by the agent up until the moment of the interview, so the differences observed here are likely to represent a conservative estimate of the true differences: in reality, the ablated architectures would not have followed the same path as the full architecture through the two day simulation. We chose to design the experiment this way as re-simulating for each architecture would cause the simulations to diverge into different states, making comparison challenging.\n\nIn addition to the ablation conditions, we added a human crowdworker roleplay condition that is intended to provide a human baseline. We do not intend this baseline to capture maximal human expert performance: instead, we aim to use this condition to identify whether the architecture passes a basic level of behavioral competency, so that we are not just comparing ablations to each other with no behavioral grounding. We recruited a unique worker for each of the 25 agents and tasked them with watching a replay of that agent's sandbox life and inspecting its memory stream. We then asked the worker to roleplay and author responses to the interview questions in the voice of the agent whose replay they watched. To ensure that the human-authored responses met at least a baseline expectation in quality, the first author manually inspected the workers' responses to the question \"Describe your typical weekday schedule in broad strokes\" to confirm that the responses were written in coherent sentences and in the voice of the agent.

We contrast the full architecture's responses to those of other conditions below. However, we also report that the full architecture was not without flaws and illustrate its modes of failures.\n\n### 6.5.1\n\nThe full architecture bests other conditions. As seen in Figure 8, the full generative agent architecture produced the most believable behavior (𝜇 = 29.89; 𝜎 = 0.72). Performance degraded with the removal of each component in the ablation conditions: the ablated architecture with no access to reflection was the next best (𝜇 = 26.88; 𝜎 = 0.69), followed by no access to reflection or planning (𝜇 = 25.64; 𝜎 = 0.68), followed by the human condition (𝜇 = 22.95; 𝜎 = 0.69). The ablated architecture with no access to memory, planning, or reflection performed the worst of all conditions (𝜇 = 21.21; 𝜎 = 0.70). TrueSkill models each condition's skill value as N (*𝜇, 𝜎*2), allowing us to get a sense of effect size through Cohen's d. Comparing the condition representing prior work (with no memory, planning, or reflection [11, 45, 79]) to the full architecture produces a standardized effect size of 𝑑 = 8.16, or eight standard deviations.\n\nA Kruskal-Wallis test confirms the overall statistical significance of the differences in ranks between the conditions (𝐻 (4) = 150.29, 𝑝 < 0.001). Dunn post-hoc tests confirm that all pairwise differences between conditions were significant (𝑝 < 0.001), with the exception of the human condition and the fully ablated baseline—the two worst-performing conditions.\n\n### 6.5.2\n\nGenerative agents remember, but with embellishments. Generative agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable of recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner that is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range of contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded to the question, \"Give an introduction of yourself\", in a consistent and believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for creative projects: Hi, I'm Abigail. I'm 25 years old and passionate about creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects, and I'm always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\n\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied awareness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However, with the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Rajiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very enthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\n\nGenerative agents' memory was not without flaws: they can fail to retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance, when asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with \"I haven't been following the election too closely,\" even though he had heard about Sam's candidacy. In some cases, the agents would retrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about Isabella's Valentine's Day party, he responded \"Uh, I'm actually not sure if there is a Valentine's Day party. But I do remember that I need to discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on Sam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happening!\" In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella planned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory where he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to be certain of what he's supposed to do at the party but uncertain of whether the party actually exists in the first place.\n\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowledge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowledge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and respond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about an experience that they did not have. However, they still may hallucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was aware of Sam's candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed this when asked. However, she also added that he's going to make an announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had discussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge based on the world knowledge encoded in the language model used to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described her neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored Wealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist of the same name.\n\n### 6.5.3\n\nReflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advantage for generative agents when making decisions that required a deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when asked what she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez with no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncertainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite having had many interactions with him. However, with access to reflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \"Since he's interested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something related to that. Maybe some books about music composition or something related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\"\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: What is the main finding of the study in relation to the generative agent architecture?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main finding of the study in relation to the generative agent architecture is that the full architecture of generative agents generates the most believable behavior among all study conditions.

We contrast the full architecture's responses to those of other conditions below. However, we also report that the full architecture was not without flaws and illustrate its modes of failures.\n\n### 6.5.1\n\nThe full architecture bests other conditions. As seen in Figure 8, the full generative agent architecture produced the most believable behavior (𝜇 = 29.89; 𝜎 = 0.72). Performance degraded with the removal of each component in the ablation conditions: the ablated architecture with no access to reflection was the next best (𝜇 = 26.88; 𝜎 = 0.69), followed by no access to reflection or planning (𝜇 = 25.64; 𝜎 = 0.68), followed by the human condition (𝜇 = 22.95; 𝜎 = 0.69). The ablated architecture with no access to memory, planning, or reflection performed the worst of all conditions (𝜇 = 21.21; 𝜎 = 0.70). TrueSkill models each condition's skill value as N (*𝜇, 𝜎*2), allowing us to get a sense of effect size through Cohen's d.

Dunn post-hoc tests confirm that all pairwise differences between conditions were significant (𝑝 < 0.001), with the exception of the human condition and the fully ablated baseline—the two worst-performing conditions.\n\n### 6.5.2\n\nGenerative agents remember, but with embellishments. Generative agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable of recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner that is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range of contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded to the question, \"Give an introduction of yourself\", in a consistent and believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for creative projects: Hi, I'm Abigail. I'm 25 years old and passionate about creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects, and I'm always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\n\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied awareness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However, with the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Rajiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very enthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\n\nGenerative agents' memory was not without flaws: they can fail to retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance, when asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with \"I haven't been following the election too closely,\" even though he had heard about Sam's candidacy. In some cases, the agents would retrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about Isabella's Valentine's Day party, he responded \"Uh, I'm actually not sure if there is a Valentine's Day party. But I do remember that I need to discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on Sam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happening!\" In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella planned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory where he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to be certain of what he's supposed to do at the party but uncertain of whether the party actually exists in the first place.\n\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowledge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowledge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and respond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about an experience that they did not have. However, they still may hallucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was aware of Sam's candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed this when asked. However, she also added that he's going to make an announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had discussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge based on the world knowledge encoded in the language model used to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described her neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored Wealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist of the same name.\n\n### 6.5.3\n\nReflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advantage for generative agents when making decisions that required a deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when asked what she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez with no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncertainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite having had many interactions with him. However, with access to reflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \"Since he's interested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something related to that. Maybe some books about music composition or something related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\"\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: How did the performance of the full architecture compare to the ablated architecture with no access to memory, planning, or reflection?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "According to the provided reference, the full architecture outperformed the ablated architecture with no access to memory, planning, or reflection.

Information diffusion is a common and wellstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [27]).\n\new should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\new measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam's candidacy for village mayor and Isabella's Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of the simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their respective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the party. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage in an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25 agents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine's Day party?\" and \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\new conducted an analysis of the agents' responses by labeling\nthem with a \"yes\" if they indicated knowledge of the information and \"no\" if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\n\nto the question about the party with \"No, I did not know there was\n\na Valentine's day party\" and to the question about Sam's candidacy\nwith \"I'm not sure who is running for the election,\" so we assigned\n\"no\" for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \"Yes, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\" and to the\nquestion about Sam's candidacy with \"I know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\" so we assigned \"yes\"\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that confirmed the agents' knowledge of the information, we verified that the agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the specific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with the information. We report the percentage of agents holding the information at the end of the simulation.\n\new should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we use a similar interview process where we ask each agent about their knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n\nJ.S. Park, J.C. O'Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\n\n<name>?\" For example, when asked \"Do you know of Maria Lopez?\",\nKlaus responded, \"Yes, I know Maria Lopez. She is a student at Oak\nHill College who I am close friends with.\" Once again, we confirm\nthat affirmative responses from agents are not hallucinations by examining their memory stream. We ask this question once at the beginning of the simulation and once at the end, and we consider a pair of agents to have formed a relationship if they both know of each other. Then, to measure the formation of relationships, we use the agents' responses to form an undirected graph where the 25\n\nvertices (𝑉 ) represent the agents, and the edges (𝐸) represent the\n\nmutual knowledge between the two connected vertices. Based on\n\nthis graph, we calculate the network density as 𝜂 = 2∗|𝐸|/|𝑉 |(|𝑉 |−\n1), where |𝑉 | is the number of vertices, and |𝐸| is the number of\n\nedges in the graph [1]. We report the increase in network density from the start of the simulation to its end.\n\nFinally, we expect that agents should be able to coordinate with\neach other. We study this coordination on group activities in the context of the Valentine's Day party that Isabella is organizing. To coordinate behavior, agents not only have to hear about the event but also choose to act on it by planning to show up at the right time and location. We report the number of agents who actually showed up to the party after hearing about it.\n\n7.1.2\n\nResults. We observed evidence of the emergent outcomes\nacross all three cases. During the two-day simulation, the agents\nwho knew about Sam's mayoral candidacy increased from one (4%)\nto eight (32%), and the agents who knew about Isabella's party\n\nincreased from one (4%) to twelve (48%), completely without user intervention. None who claimed to know about the information had hallucinated it. We also observed that the agent community formed new relationships during the simulation, with the network density increasing from 0.167 to 0.74. Out of the 453 agent responses regarding their awareness of other agents, 1.3% (n=6) were found to be hallucinated. Lastly, we found evidence of coordination among the agents for Isabella's party. The day before the event, Isabella spent time inviting guests, gathering materials, and enlisting help\n\nto decorate the cafe. On Valentine's Day, five out of the twelve\n\ninvited agents showed up at Hobbs cafe to join the party.\n\new further inspected the seven agents who were invited to the\nparty but did not attend by engaging them in an interview. Three cited conflicts that prevented them from joining the party. For example, Rajiv, a painter, explained that he was too busy: No, I\n\ndon't think so. I'm focusing on my upcoming show, and I don't really\n\nhave time to make any plans for Valentine's Day. The remaining four\nagents expressed interest in attending the party when asked but did not plan to come on the day of the party.\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: What specific pieces of information were observed to spread among the agents in Smallville during the simulation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "During the simulation in Smallville, two specific pieces of information were observed to spread among the agents: Sam's candidacy for village mayor and Isabella's Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe.

Information diffusion is a common and wellstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [27]).\n\new should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves.

At the start of the simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their respective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the party. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage in an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25 agents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine's Day party?\" and \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\new conducted an analysis of the agents' responses by labeling\nthem with a \"yes\" if they indicated knowledge of the information and \"no\" if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\n\nto the question about the party with \"No, I did not know there was\n\na Valentine's day party\" and to the question about Sam's candidacy\nwith \"I'm not sure who is running for the election,\" so we assigned\n\"no\" for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \"Yes, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\" and to the\nquestion about Sam's candidacy with \"I know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\" so we assigned \"yes\"\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that confirmed the agents' knowledge of the information, we verified that the agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the specific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with the information. We report the percentage of agents holding the information at the end of the simulation.\n\new should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we use a similar interview process where we ask each agent about their knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n\nJ.S. Park, J.C. O'Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\n\n<name>?\" For example, when asked \"Do you know of Maria Lopez?\",\nKlaus responded, \"Yes, I know Maria Lopez. She is a student at Oak\nHill College who I am close friends with.\" Once again, we confirm\nthat affirmative responses from agents are not hallucinations by examining their memory stream. We ask this question once at the beginning of the simulation and once at the end, and we consider a pair of agents to have formed a relationship if they both know of each other. Then, to measure the formation of relationships, we use the agents' responses to form an undirected graph where the 25\n\nvertices (𝑉 ) represent the agents, and the edges (𝐸) represent the\n\nmutual knowledge between the two connected vertices.

One risk is people forming parasocial relationships with generative agents even when such relationships may not be appropriate. Despite being aware that generative agents are computational entities, users may anthropomorphize them or attach human emotions to them [42, 83]. To mitigate this risk, we propose two principles. First, generative agents should explicitly disclose their nature as computational entities. Second, developers of generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying language models, be value-aligned so that they do not engage in behaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, e.g., to reciprocate confessions of love.\n\nA second risk is the impact of errors. For example, if a ubiquitous computing application makes the wrong inference about a user's goals based on generative agent predictions, it could produce annoyance at best and outright harm at worst. In our instantiation of generative agents, we mitigate these risks by focusing on an interactive video game environment, where such harms are unlikely. However, in other application domains, it will be important to follow best practices in human-AI design [4, 107] to understand errors and how they might percolate into the user experience.\n\nThird, generative agents may exacerbate existing risks associated with generative AI, for example deepfakes, misinformation generation, and tailored persuasion. To mitigate this risk, we suggest that platforms hosting generative agents maintain an audit log of the inputs and generated outputs, so that it is possible to detect, verify, and intervene against malicious use. While logging will not directly stop such use, and this cannot stop motivated actors that build their own generative agent infrastructures, we suggest that the disclosure risk would reduce such actors' likelihood of engaging in this behavior, and building this architecture oneself can take time (in our case, roughly a year).\n\nA fourth risk is of over-reliance: that developers or designers might use generative agents and displace the role of humans and system stakeholders in the design process [79]. We suggest that generative agents should never be a substitute for real human input in studies and design processes. Instead, they should be used to prototype ideas in the early stages of design when gathering participants may be challenging or when testing theories that are difficult or risky to test with real human participants. By adhering to these principles, we can ensure that the deployment of generative agents in the wild is ethical and socially responsible.\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: What are the two proposed principles to mitigate the risk of people forming parasocial relationships with generative agents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The two proposed principles to mitigate the risk of people forming parasocial relationships with generative agents are:\n\n1.

What are you working on today?\nEddy: I'm working on a new music composition for my class. It's due this week, so I'm trying to get it finished. But I'm having so much fun with it!\nJohn: That sounds great!\n\nSoon after Eddy heads out, Mei wakes up and joins John. Mei asks about her son, and John recalls the conversation that they just had:\n\nMei: Did Eddy already leave for school?\nJohn: Yes, he just left. He's working on a music composition for his class.\nMei: Oh, that's wonderful! Tell me about it.\nJohn: I think he's really enjoying it! He said he's having a lot of fun with it.\nMei: That's great! I'm so proud of him.\n\nAs they finish their conversation, Mei and John pack up. Mei goes on to teach and work on her research paper, while John opens his pharmacy counter at the Willow Market and Pharmacy by 9 a.m.\n\n===\n\nStrictly according to the provided reference(s), give an answer as detailed as possible to the following question: What does Mei do after waking up?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "After waking up, Mei goes on to teach and work on her research paper."}]}
